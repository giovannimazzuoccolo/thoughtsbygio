This post demonstrates various markdown formatting options that work beautifully with our classic science book aesthetic. Perfect for documenting frontend techniques and UX insights.

## Typography and Text Formatting

You can use **bold text** for emphasis, _italic text_ for subtle highlights, and `inline code` for technical terms like `useState` or `flexbox`.

### Code Blocks

Here's a JavaScript example:

```javascript
const useTheme = () => {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState("light");

  const toggleTheme = () => {
    setTheme((prev) => (prev === "light" ? "dark" : "light"));
  };

  return { theme, toggleTheme };
};
```

CSS styling:

```css
.button {
  padding: 0.75rem 1.5rem;
  border-radius: 6px;
  transition: all 0.2s ease;
}

.button:hover {
  transform: translateY(-2px);
  box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
}
```

## Lists and Organization

### Unordered Lists

- User experience principles
- Accessibility considerations
- Performance optimization
  - Image compression
  - Code splitting
  - Lazy loading

### Ordered Lists

1. Research and discovery
2. Wireframing and prototyping
3. Visual design
4. Development and testing
5. Launch and iteration

## Tables

| Framework | Bundle Size | Learning Curve | Performance |
| --------- | ----------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| React     | Medium      | Moderate       | Good        |
| Vue       | Small       | Easy           | Excellent   |
| Svelte    | Tiny        | Moderate       | Excellent   |

## Mathematical Expressions

When discussing UX metrics, you might need formulas like:

Conversion Rate = (Conversions ÷ Total Visitors) × 100

## Final Thoughts

This markdown formatting provides a solid foundation for technical writing about frontend development and user experience design. The classic typography enhances readability while maintaining a professional, scholarly appearance.
